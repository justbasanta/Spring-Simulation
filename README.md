# Spring-Simulation
This is the mini project done for Computer Graphics. It is a simulation of spring system done using p5.js.

To run the project, first clone this repository on your PC. I've used CDN to run the project so no extra installation is necessary. If you have internet you're good to go.

Head inside spring_simulation folder and run index.html in your browser and the project will run.
